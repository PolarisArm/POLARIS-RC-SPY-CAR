__POLARIS RC SPY CAR__ is a personal fun project based on __ROBODUINO CARRIER BOARD for Arduino nano (ATMEGA328PB)__<br>
I made this with __ROBODUINO CARRIER BOARD__ beacuse every time I try to build 4WD robot there will be pin shortage <br>
say PWM pin for Servo or SPI pin or some pin for other function. Roboduino carrier board does not create such problem.It<br>
communicates with arduino nano with just two pin namely via I2C communication pin, so most of the arduino pin is available for <br>
other use.
